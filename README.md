# TetrisUnity
A near 1:1 remake of the original NES Tetris from 1989. The mechanics are (as far as I know) identical to the original, the visuals and sounds are also basically the same excluding the background and border during gameplay. Has a few modern quality of life improvements and stats displayed but nothing that affects the gameplay at all.

Please report any bugs or issues you may encounter. Feature requests are also welcome. We are also open to accepting pull requests if we feel they are well coded and add a useful feature or improvement to the game.
