A near 1:1 remake of the original NES Tetris from 1989. The mechanics are (as far as I know) identical to the original, the visuals and sounds are also basically the same excluding the background and border during gameplay. Has a few modern quality of life improvements and stats displayed but nothing that affects the gameplay at all.
