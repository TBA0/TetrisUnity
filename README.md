# TetrisUnity
A near 1:1 remake of the original NES Tetris from 1989. The mechanics are (as far as I know) identical to the original, the visuals and sounds are also basically the same excluding the background and border during gameplay. Has a few modern quality of life improvements and stats displayed but nothing that affects the gameplay at all.

Feature requests are welcome. Please report any bugs or issues you may encounter. If you feel you are capable of fixing a bug yourself, you may submit a pull request. We are also open to pull requests for new features or improvements, provided they are well made.
